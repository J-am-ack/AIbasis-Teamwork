Sample 2 (message 2): > python test_api.py
Great question! I’m **DeepSeek-V3**, created by **DeepSeek**. While my responses might resemble OpenAI's GPT-4 in style and capability, I’m an entirely different model developed by **DeepSeek**.

If you were expecting a different model (like GPT-4o), it might be due to similarities in how we process and generate text. But rest assured—I'm **DeepSeek-V3**, and I’m here to help! 😊

Would you like me to clarify anything else?
